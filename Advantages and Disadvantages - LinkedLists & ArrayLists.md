#Advantages and Disadvantages of LinkedList: 

Advantages Of LinkedList:

    No memory wastage: No need to give the initial size of the linked list and  pre-allocate the memory, which saves space. 
    Implementation: Linear data structures are often easily implemented using a linked list.
    Insertion and Deletion Operations: There is no need to shift elements after the insertion or deletion of an element, which saves time.

Disadvantages Of LinkedList:

    Memory usage: More memory is required in the linked list as compared to an array. Because in a linked list, a pointer is also required to store the address of the next element and it requires extra memory for itself.
    Traversal: In a Linked list traversal is more time-consuming as compared to an array. Direct access to an element is not possible in a linked list as in an array by index. 
    Random Access: Random access is not possible in a linked list due to its dynamic memory allocation.

#Advantages and Disadvantages of ArrayList: 

Advantages Of ArrayList:

		Transveral: Provides fast iteration of elements using indexing.
		Memory Coherance: elements are stored in a sequential memory location.

Disadvantages Of ArrayList:

    Time: Addition or deletion of data from the middle is time consuming as data needs to be shifted to update the list
		Size of Array: There is oftan wasted space when the arrayList resizes after reaching it's capacity
